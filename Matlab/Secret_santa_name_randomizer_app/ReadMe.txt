This is a small GUI that I created in MATLAB that I created during a trip with my friends to practice MATLAB app designer.
You need to assign everyone a number and then and then get them to put it anonymously into the interface with their number 
on the top left and number on the bottom left.
Once everyone has done this you can press "finish setup".
Then each person needs to anonymously enter their number into the box on the right with a number and press "get target" to see 
who they are responsible for!
